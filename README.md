**StreamScribe AI: Real-time Video Streaming with Integrated Subtitle Generation and Chatbot Interaction**

**Project Overview:**
This project aims to develop an innovative real-time video streaming service integrated with subtitle generation and chatbot interaction. The service will support educational playlists and video content from platforms such as YouTube. It will leverage big data analytics to enhance the user experience by providing real-time transcription, video analysis, and interactive chatbot engagement through a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) model.

The project will involve two key use cases: 
1. **Dump Processing** for archived video analysis.
2. **Real-Time Processing** for live video analysis and interaction.

**Key Features:**
- **Video Streaming and Transcription:** Videos will be fetched from platforms like YouTube, and subtitles will be automatically generated.
- **Frame Analysis:** Key frames containing important information (e.g., diagrams, figures) will be identified using subtitle timestamps and sent to a vision model for description.
- **Chatbot Interaction:** A chatbot will allow users to ask questions based on the video's content, leveraging RAG for enhanced responses.
- **Data Storage and Processing:** Video content will be stored on Amazon S3, while subtitles and frame descriptions will be processed using PySpark and integrated with the RAG model for efficient question-answering.
- **Multimodal Interaction:** In real-time mode, users will have the option to interact with current frames, sending them along with prompts to a multimodal AI model for a richer interaction experience.

**Dataflow Architecture:**

**Case 1: Dump Processing**
1. **Video and Subtitle Retrieval:**
   - Fetch the video and subtitles from YouTube.
2. **Frame Identification:**
   - Use subtitle timestamps to identify frames with significant information such as diagrams or figures.
3. **Frame Description:**
   - Extract frames and send them to a vision model to generate descriptions.
4. **Storage and RAG Integration:**
   - Store videos in Amazon S3.
   - Store subtitle texts and frame descriptions in PySpark for data processing.
   - Subtitle and frame descriptions will be encoded and stored in a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) model for future question answering.
   
**Case 2: Real-Time Processing**
1. **Real-Time Video and Subtitle Retrieval:**
   - Fetch video and subtitles from YouTube.
2. **Interactive User Engagement:**
   - Users can interact with current frames, sending them along with their prompts to a multimodal AI model for real-time interaction.
3. **Real-Time Processing:**
   - Real-time interaction does not require the RAG model but will be handled by a serverless architecture such as AWS Lambda for scalable, low-latency performance.
