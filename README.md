# StreamScribe

**Project Overview:**
StreamScribe is a web application designed to stream videos from Amazon S3 buckets and provide an AI-driven chat interface for users to interact with video content. It leverages Streamlit for the web interface, OpenAI for chat functionality, and AWS services for infrastructure.

## Key Components

### Infrastructure (AWS)

- **VPC:** A virtual private cloud with public and private subnets.
- **Security Group:** Allows inbound traffic on ports 22 (SSH) and 8080 (Streamlit app).
- **S3 Bucket:** Stores video files and subtitles.
- **EC2 Instance:** Runs the Streamlit application and handles video downloads.
- **IAM Role and Policy:** Grants access to S3 resources for the EC2 instance.

### Streamlit Application

- **Video Streaming:** Displays videos from S3 using pre-signed URLs.
- **Chat Interface:** Uses OpenAI to process user queries about video content.
- **Subtitles:** Fetches and displays subtitles for selected videos.

### Automation and Deployment

- **Terraform:** Manages infrastructure provisioning.
- **User Data Script:** Installs necessary packages and sets up the environment on the EC2 instance.
- **Systemd Service (`streamscribe.service`):** Ensures the Streamlit app runs continuously.

### Video Download Script (`vid_down.sh`)

- **Functionality:** Downloads YouTube videos in multiple formats (merged video, best quality video+audio, audio-only, thumbnail, subtitles, and metadata) using `yt-dlp`.
- **Uploads:** All downloaded files are uploaded to the S3 bucket.
- **CSV Update:** Updates a CSV file with S3 object keys and local file paths.

## Functionality

- **Video Selection:** Users can select a video from a list and view it with subtitles.
- **AI Chat Interface:** Users can ask questions about the video content through a chat interface.
- **AI Responses:** The system uses AI to respond to user queries based on video context.

## Security and Access

- **SSH Access:** Secured with a private key for the EC2 instance.
- **S3 Bucket Access:** Accessible only through pre-signed URLs generated by the application.

## Future Enhancements

- **AI Model Integration:** Improve AI model integration for more accurate responses.
- **Video Format Support:** Add support for multiple video formats and sources.
- **Security Enhancements:** Enhance security by limiting access to specific IP ranges.
- **Video Processing:** Integrate more advanced video processing capabilities in the `vid_down.sh` script.
